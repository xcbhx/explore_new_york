      <p>Welcome to the Explore New York! 
        I’ve always loved living in New York and discovering its 
        hidden gems, from beautiful museums to vibrant street art. 
        I created this site to share my favorite spots and help others 
        explore the city’s rich culture, food, and history. Whether 
        you're a local or a visitor, I hope this guide helps you uncover 
        new places to love in NYC!
